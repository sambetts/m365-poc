## Out of Process Excel
This project demonstrates how code can be run outside of the Excel. An Excel add-in calls an external server daemon to run code that may consume lots of memory.

This allows 32bit Excel to exceed the 4gb limit if needed, if you can't run 64bit Excel for compatability reasons.
